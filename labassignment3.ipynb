    "JSON and CSV are both text-based formats for the storage of data. It's possible to open either one in a plain text editor. Given this similarity, why does a CSV file usually take less memory than a JSON formatted file for the same data? Under what conditions could a JSON file be smaller in memory than a CSV file for the same data? (2 points)"
